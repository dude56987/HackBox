TODO:
* change the way sources files work, create 3 types of entrys, type is defined in the first spot
	delimiter is <:>
	type 1 is package installer example below
		package<:>/usr/bin/radiotray<:>install message goes here<:>radiotray
			the first value is the type,
			the second is the file to check for, if it exists then do not install, 
			the third is the install message to be shown on screen, 
			the fourth is the package name
	type 2 is a command to run example below
		command<:>message goes here<:>update
			the first value is the datatype
			the second is the message to show before the command
			the third is the command itself that will be passed to the shell
	type 3 is something I forgot but I hope I remember latter because it was genius
* system upgrades
	setup a text file on the website of the latest mint and getdeb and ubuntu package sources
	do a cron.monthly download of that textfile and notify the user a upgrade is available if it diffs from the currently installed base sources
	using zenity or tkmessages give the user a simple yes or no on the upgrade process but inform them that it can take a long ammount of time, a lot of network usage and a plugged in charger to work, check for battery with folder /proc/apci/battery or some such shit
	also mention that the upgrade process is not recommended and could potentally break the system
	recommend a backup before proceeding with the process
	also this will neeed some testing for each release but I think its a good idea in general for a upgrade path to exist when using mint
