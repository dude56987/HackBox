the status bar was replaced with the \"Add-on Bar\", an empty, but customizable, toolbar. While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.

On MacOSX these tabs have reverse appearance like on pre-Australis builds.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication menu titlebar button [Windows only]\nThe appmenu titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left side like on it was since Fx 4. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication menu toolbar button\nThe appmenu toolbar button is a default toolbar menu button and can be placed on any available toolbar.\nIf it is moved to tabs toolbar while the menubar is disabled, the appbutton appears on browsers titlebar (Windows only). Otherwise it appears like a default toolbar button placed on any toolbar.\n\nApplication button colors\nOn tabs toolbar and on titlebar the appbutton can be colored orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), transparent, blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray [in normal browsing mode] and purple [in private browsing mode] like on previous Windows browser versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. Some elements like 'splitmenu' are not available in Firefox Australis anymore, so menuitem and a submenu are placed in a row now. The appmenu also misses some non-cloneable menuitems inside developer- and options submenus.\n\nSmall nav-bar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate small icon view.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding nav-bar might be interesting after its items get moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at windows bottom simulates the 'old' add-on bar. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar) or can be toggled using 'Ctrl+/' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd+/' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nAnother toolbar below top toolbars, where buttons and items can be moved to. It can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar).\n\nFindbar on top or at the bottom\nForces findbar to be displayed on top or at the bottom.\n\nIcons + text\nDisplay text below toolbar buttons.\n\nText only\nReplace toolbar button icons with text.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nThe bookmarks menu button is a default 'toolbar menu button'. On personal toolbar its label and icon are visible.\n\nBookmarks sidebar button\nThe bookmarks sidebar button toggles the bookmarks sidebar.\n\nHistory sidebar button\nThe history sidebar button toggles the history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTB recreates these buttons.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace stop and reload buttons in that order on any toolbar and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hover the option on options window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces and flexible spaces\nA couple of toolbar items simulate spaces and flexible spaces. They can be moved to toolbars like toolbar buttons using browsers customize menu.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nKnown 'issues'/'glitches'/extra info\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox reslves the problem. This glitch is caused by MS Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using pre-Australis colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n\nNotes\n1) Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with older versions and will certainly break some parts of the UI or not work correctly at all.\n2) This add-on was made for browsers default theme and will certainly break parts of the UI especially tabs, if used along with Firefox themes or Personas, but additional buttons and their options could work fine (untested!).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1396443041","width":"167","height":"125","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1396443041","thumbnailWidth":"167","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Main
