was removed in Firefox 4.0. While some of the status bar items did find new homes, some did not, and you might not like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4.0, such as progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back (some of) the old status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", and \"Download Status\" items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the extension preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    By default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","developerComments":"Users that have installed the development/beta version: because you are on the beta channel, you will not receive automatic updates for non-beta releases.
