Reading this help file
######################
    It may seem harsh but this document will start from the very begining. This help document will assume that you have absolutly no knowlege of what the hell you may be doing. So to start with.

- j will move you down.
- k will move you up.
- / will start a search.
- <enter> will preform that search.
- n will move to the next found instance of the word you searched for.
- <home> will bring you back to the top of the document. So if you get lost hit home.
- q will close this help file

    You may want to practice moving around a bit before you advance to the next section of the help document. You can just skim around and look at what this document has to offer you in terms of knowlege.

Super basic moving around
#########################
    Ok so before we get into using the terminal lets explain where you are right now. This is a terminal based window manager. It makes the terminal easier to use. Using this program you can create and switch between new terminal windows though for simplicitys sake we will call them windows. So using this program it is much easier to control and move though these windows. Each window acts as a individual terminal for the user and is seprate of the commands executed in the others. This means you can run a command in one window and while you are waiting for it to finish you can create a new window and launch some other commands. The basics of using this system consists of the following three commands.
    
- f2 will create a new window
- f3 will switch to the window on the left of current
- f4 will switch to the window on the right of current

    These commands should be enough to get you started working with windows. If you are wondering what to the right and left means. Look at the bottom of your screen. This is the window list. Like the graphical enviorment your open windows will be displayed along the bottom and the selected one will be highlighted. This is what I mean by "right of" and "left of". So to get used to this concept go ahead and give it a try. Create a few new windows with the f2 key and then switch around between them. If you get to many you can always close a window by typing exit and then striking the enter key.

The Mouse
#########
    This interface being setup for user friendlyness as far as terminal programs go. Has the mouse enabled. Go ahead move it around and you should see it onscreen. Some programs on the terminal allow you to use the mouse to click though menus but for the most part it is used for copy and paste operations. This is done by highlighting what you want to copy by left clicking and draging and then middle clicking to paste. This works anywhere in the terminal.

Terminal basics
###############
    Welcome to the terminal this is the oldschool interface with all the power you can imagine and lots of it you cant. Anyway the terminal uses commands to interact with the computer. So this will consist of you typing the command and then executing it with the enter key. This can be daunting at first since you really dont know any of the commands avaliable. So to start you off I will give you eyes and legs in your system so to speak. 

    Protip about commands. Commands once used are stored and to view your previous commands you can use the up arrow on the keyboard. If you go to far back you can use the down arrow to go back toward the bottom of the list. 

    The first command is the ls command. You simply type ls and hit enter. This will list all files in your current directory, if you are unfimilar with the term directory some systems call a directory a folder. After this I will refer to them only as folders. Anyway this command will list the folders and files in the current directory you are looking at. Go ahead and flip over to another window and try it out.

    The second command is the walking part. This will let you move into or out of a directory. This command is cd. This command stands for change directory and does just that. Take for example you run a ls in your home directory and see a folder named derp. You are curious what is in derp and want to view its contents. You simply would type cd derp and it would move you into that directory. Where you may now use the ls command to view the contents of the directory.

Searching for and installing new software
#########################################
* To search for software use aptitude e.g.

    aptitude search packageName

* Or to search the discription

    aptitude search -d descriptiveWord

* Or to browse through the curses interface

    aptitude

* When you are ready to install software use

    apt-fast install packageName

Other Programs for Other Tasks
##############################
    This is a list of programs for various things you will find usefull on the terminal. Hopefully this saves you a lot of looking around for stuff. Not all of these are installed by default ,but they can be with the command "installConsoleTools".

pdmenu ---------> Menu for launching apps with curses interface(Hit f3 or f4 enough and you will find it)
mocp -----------> Music player with curses interface
wicd-curses ----> Wifi and network config tool with curses based interface
mc -------------> midnight commander is a curses file manager with a extensive feature set
weechat-curses -> IRC client
finch ----------> Chat Client(facebook,jabber,yahoo,etc.)
fbgrab ---------> Screenshot Tool for CLI
alpine ---------> Email Client Curses interface
alsamixer ------> Sound Mixer Control
elinks ---------> Web Browser

Programs with kinda graphics
############################
    On the terminal it is possible to do graphics however they are done through the framebuffer. This creates some issues with the whole current setup of everything you are viewing right now. So to overcome this you must open a seprate tty <ctrl>+<alt>+<f2>. To get back here use <ctrl>+<alt>+<f1>. Take note however that these programs will not work over ssh, at least to the extent of my knowlege.

links2 -g ------> Framebuffer web browser, must be used in tty2 or above

Customization
#############
    In order to customize the terminal there are some diffrent things you can do. The most common thing people want to work with is the font and font size. In order to modify this you need to open a new terminal window and use the following command.

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

    Or for the lazy people like me a alias has been created so you can simply type
    
    console-setup
    
    Another thing you might wish to do would be to customize the windows that start open on your terminal. This is not so bad but does require editing a config file. You can edit this config file with the following command.

    nano ~/.byobu/windows

    The current config file should allow you to figure out how to modify the text to make any set of windows that you want. Beware though that this requires that you disable the help file forever on login to the terminal. This shouldnt be a problem for anyone who has reached a proficency with the terminal where they are confortable doing so. Furthermore this help file is always reachable with the command

    less ~/.terminalHelpFile

    There is also another thing you can mess with called the alias command. This command will allow you to make a keyword into any string of commands you would like. So for instance the ll comand on here. It invokes the command "ls -la" thereby reducing your typing. This can be extended as far as your imagination and processing power will allow. To edit these commands they are invoked in the .zshenv file. You can edit this file via nano with the command

    nano ~/.zshenv

    On a slight side note that is also where all the logic for this entire setup is stored. You will be able to mess with the alias commands on the top without trouble though.
