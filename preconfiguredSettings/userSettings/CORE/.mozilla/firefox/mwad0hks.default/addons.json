It \"tweaks\" the Firefox download manager with small changes and doesn't completely redesign it. It makes some optional changes to its appearance and allows it to be opened in a separate window, a new tab, or the sidebar. Additional features beyond appearance include deleting a downloaded file and re-downloading a mistakenly deleted file. The various appearance changes can be disabled, if you don't like the look and just want it to open in a tab or sidebar.\n\nFirefox 45 made changes that broke parts of DMT. Not being able to delete files inside DMT was one. DMT inside a sidebar was another. DMT 1.0.10 fixes those. A third bug is the browse button inside the options screen (apparently broken as early as Firefox 38). That bug is not yet fixed.\n\nThe DMT option to select where downloads go is broken for now. However, there is a selection on the Firefox General Options page which does work. DMT reuses the same code that is on the General Options page but it stopped working and I haven't found a fix yet.\n\nSome old DMT features still missing include: reload after a file is mistakenly deleted, and the colorful icons in the list of downloads.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/2/2982.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"528","height":"490","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/2/2982.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"161","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Download Manager Tweak Window"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/2/2983.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"689","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/2/2983.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"196","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Download Manager Tweak Tab"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/2/2984.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"412","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/2/2984.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"117","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Download Manager Tweak Sidebar"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/35/35227.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"455","height":"386","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/35/35227.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Download Manager Tweak File/Window Options"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/39/39897.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"455","height":"386","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/39/39897.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Download Manager Tweak Buttons Options"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/39/39898.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"455","height":"386","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/39/39898.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Download Manager Tweak Advanced Options"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-manager-tweak/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://dmextension.mozdev.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/417561/download_manager_tweak-1.0.10-fx.xpi?src=api","size":132217,"developerComments":"Remember that the appearance can be changed with the many option settings.

Everything can be disabled.\n    Easy for beginners, powerful for advanced users. Not just for Vim fanatics.\n    Modeled after Vimium for Chrome.\n\nNew to VimFx? Check out Questions & Answers!\nPower user? Make a config file!\nIn either case, have look at the the documentation and the wiki.\n\nVimFx is made by these awesome people.\n\nWhy VimFx was created\n\n    Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That’s why I decided to develop similar extension for Firefox.\n\n     VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.\n\n    – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx’s original author.\n\n\nKey Features\nVimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply invoke native Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar functionality.\n\nFollow links, focus text inputs and click buttons using hint markers by pressing f. This command has many variations, for example to copy links or open them in new tabs.\n\nSearch with / and cycle between matches with n and N.\n\nOpen a new tab with t, close it with x. Reopen it again with X. Switch between tabs with J and K, or some of the several other tab commands.\n\nScrolling left/down/up/right: h, j, k, l.\nTop/Bottom: gg, G.\nPage up/down: space, shift-space.\nHalf a page: d, u.\n\nThere are of course many more shortcuts! Press ? to see them all, and then / to search among them. Click on a command or open VimFx’s settings page in the Add-ons Manager to customize the default shortcuts.\n\nYou can temporarily disable VimFx by using Ignore mode. Press i to enter it, and shift-escape to exit. Use the blacklist to automatically enter Ignore mode on specific sites.\n\nThere’s also an article on ghacks.net which is a good introduction.\n\nFeedback\nEnjoying VimFx?

While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports.

'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar.

On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer).\nProfile Switcher add-on and Profilist add-on can help creating new profiles.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally

You can visually group related tabs, switch between groups, and quickly search through all of your tabs to switch to a specific one.","fullDescription":"Contact Info: For reporting problems and bugs, or if you have comments or suggestions, please either send me an email (quicksaver@gmail.com) or go to https://github.com/Quicksaver/Tab-Groups/issues and create an issue, this is so I have a way to communicate with you if I need to.\n\nTab Groups, formerly known as Panorama or TabView, allows you to manage and organize a large number of open tabs.\n\nGroups are incredibly easy to use! When you first install the add-on, the Tab Groups button will appear next to your tabs, but you can move it anywhere you want in the window. Use it to open a quick access panel to quickly switch between your groups or even to switch to a specific tab.\n\nEnter groups management view through that panel and drag tabs across groups or out of their current group to create a new one. When you're done, just click on a tab to leave groups view and go to the chosen tab; only the tabs in the chosen group will be visible. It's that simple.\n\nYou can name groups, resize them and rearrange them visually however you like. Create groups for research, movies, work, fun and all the other various tasks you perform on your browser. You'll organize all those dozens of tabs you have open in no time!\n\nOr even keep all your tabs in a single group, and use the add-on to swiftly find and switch to any tab you want, without having to lose time looking for it in the middle of all your other tabs at the top.\n\nYou can also customize a series of keyboard shortcuts in the add-on's preferences, to quickly enter and leave groups view, open the quick access panel, or switch to other groups using just your keyboard.\n\nBackup and Restore your tabs and groups any time you want! Everything crashes once in a while, but now you can be sure you never lose your tabs again when that happens.\n- Manually backup your groups information at any time to a file anywhere on your disk for safe-keeping. Later, you can restore whole groups from there, or even just a single tab if that's all you want.\n- You can also restore groups and tabs from several automated backups created by Firefox and Tab Groups:\n-- Current Session Recovery: Firefox keeps your current session's information here, to be used in case of crashes. You probably won't be using it much, since whatever groups and tabs you close will be removed from this file as well.\n-- Session Recovery Backup: holds much of the same information as the file above, also used for crash-protection. But it's usually saved with a little delay, so it could be useful in a few cases.\n-- Previous Session: ever restart Firefox to see only your homepage, and all your other tabs gone? Or maybe just forgot to bookmark an important tab from yesterday? More often than not, you can get it all back here.\n-- Firefox Upgrade Backup: every time Firefox upgrades, it holds onto a backup of your session at that point for a while, just in case the upgrade fails and corrupts the session. These should help if all you need is to get your tabs back from before the upgrade.\n-- Tab Groups Update Backup: similar to the above, but for backups created when this add-on updates instead.\n-- Groups Migration Backup: this is a backup of your session made when Firefox first updated to 45. If you've installed Firefox only after, or if you installed this add-on before that happened, then you likely will never see (or need) this.\n-- Groups Manual Backup: if you keep the default file name and save location when backing up your groups, you can also access them from the quick access menu when restoring.\n-- Session Manager Backup: these are session files kept by Session Manager, which is fully compatible with Tab Groups.\n-- Tab Mix Plus Backup: similar to the above, these are session files kept by Tab Mix Plus, which is also fully compatible with Tab Groups.\n\nOther features:\n- There are several different layouts available, as well as many display options; set them to your taste so that your groups always work to your advantage.\n- Start typing anywhere in groups view to search for a specific tab.\n- Use catch rules to automatically move tabs to specific groups by means of regular expressions.\n- Integrates with Tab Mix Plus's options to style unloaded and unread tabs.\n\nNotice: this add-on is based on the Firefox feature of the same name that was removed in Firefox 45. Initially, it was barely more than a copy of that same code that existed in Firefox itself. Since then, almost all of it has been rewritten, not only to improve performance and stability, but also to implement several new features. Despite this, the concept of groups at the core of the add-on remains the same, but hopefully even more awesome than ever.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174740.png?src=api&modified=1464726991","width":"646","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174740.png?src=api&modified=1464726991","thumbnailWidth":"185","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"When first installed, the toolbar button is placed next to the tabs.
