If so, then read carefully before filing any issue.\n\n***\n\nAn efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\n\nIllustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared\n\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","supportURL":"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":3806,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":35653071,"weeklyDownloads":500424,"dailyUsers":4857497,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/794480/ublock_origin-1.14.20-an+fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":1828803,"updateDate":1511960410000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"langpack-en-ZA@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-32.png?modified=1358351591","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-64.png?modified=1358351591"},"type":"locale","name":"English (South African) Language Pack","version":"57.0","creator":{"name":"Dwayne Bailey","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dwayne-bailey/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Translate.org.za","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/translateorgza/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Adds South African English language support to the Firefox browser.

Please see the 'Zoom Mode', 'Zoom Type' and 'Image Scaling' sections for more details.\n\nZoom Page WE is an alternative simpler no-restart version of the well established Zoom Page add-on.\n\nZoom Page WE is implemented using the new WebExtensions API and is available for both Firefox and Chrome with identical functions and user interfaces.\n\nOPTIONS PAGE\n\nThe options page for Zoom Page WE can be accessed as follows:\n\n• Firefox - On the menu bar select Tools > Add-ons (or press Ctrl+Shift+A), select the Extensions tab, and then click on the Options button.\n\n• Chrome - Right-click on the toolbar button, and then select Options.\n\nTOOLBAR BUTTON\n\nAfter installation of Zoom Page WE, there will be a new icon on the main toolbar with a blue badge showing the current zoom level.\n\nTo change the zoom level for a page, click on the Zoom Page WE toolbar button to show the popup panel, then click on one of the six buttons on the right side of the popup panel:\n\n• Zoom Type - toggles the zoom type between Full zoom and Text zoom.\n• Zoom Level (%) - shows a drop-down menu from which a specific zoom level can be selected.\n• Zoom In (+) - increases the zoom level to the next defined zoom level or by a fixed zoom step.\n• Zoom Out (-) - reduces the zoom level to the next defined zoom level or by a fixed zoom step.\n• Zoom Autofit - automatically adjusts the zoom level so the page contents fit the width of the browser window.\n• Zoom Reset - applies the defined default full/text zoom level depending on the current zoom type.\n\nNote, Ctrl+Click on the Zoom Reset button sets the default full/text zoom level to the currently applied zoom level.\n\nTo change the minimum font size for a page, click on the Zoom Page WE toolbar button to show the popup panel, then click on one of the two buttons on the left side of the popup panel:\n\n• Font Minimum Size (px) - shows a drop-down from which a specific minimum font size can be selected.\n• Font Reset - applies the defined default minimum font size.\n\nNote, Ctrl+Click on the Font Reset button sets the default font size to the currently applied font size.\n\nThere are options to:\n\n• define the set of zoom levels that are applied when zooming in/out.\n• define the default full zoom and text zoom levels.\n• define the autofit minimum and maximum zoom levels.\n• zoom to the next defined zoom level or by a fixed zoom step when zooming in/out.\n• define the fixed zoom step.\n• define the default minimum font size.\n• show the zoom level and minimum font size state on the button.\n• clear all per-site data (site-specific zoom types, zoom levels and minimum font sizes).\n\nCONTEXT MENU & BUTTON MENU\n\nTo change the zoom level of a page, right-click on the page contents to open the context menu, select the 'Zoom Page WE' sub-menu, and then select one of the menu items.\n\nAlternatively, right-click on the Zoom Page WE toolbar button to open the button menu, and then select one of the menu items.\n\nThe available menu items are:\n\n• Zoom In\n• Zoom Out\n• Zoom Reset\n• Zoom Type\n• Zoom AutoFit\n• Font Reset\n\nThese menu items have the same effect as the similarly named buttons on the toolbar button popup panel.\n\nThere is an option to show/hide the Zoom Page WE submenu on the context menu.\n\nKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\n\nTo open the toolbar button popup panel, press Alt+Z.\n\nTo change the zoom level of a page, press one of these five keyboard shortcuts:\n\n• Zoom In - Ctrl+Plus\n• Zoom Out - Ctrl+Minus\n• Zoom Reset - Ctrl+0\n• Zoom Type - Ctrl+9\n• Zoom AutoFit - Ctrl+8\n• Font Reset - Ctrl+7\n\nThese keyboard shortcuts have the same effect as the similarly named buttons on the toolbar button popup panel.\n\nThere is an option to enable/disable the Ctrl+7, Ctrl+8 and Ctrl+9 keyboard shortcuts.\n\nMOUSE WHEEL\n\nTo change the zoom level of a page, when the mouse is over the page contents, hold down the 'Ctrl' key and rotate the mouse wheel.\n\nTo change the zoom level of a page, when the mouse is over the right-side of the toolbar button popup panel, simply rotate the mouse wheel.\n\nTo change the minimum font size of a page, when the mouse is over the left-side of the toolbar button popup panel, simply rotate the mouse wheel.\n\nZOOM MODE\n\nThere is an option to set the 'Zoom Mode' as either 'Per Site' or 'Per Tab'.\n\n'Per Site' zoom is also known as 'site-specific' zoom. 'Per Tab' zoom is always independent in each tab.\n\nWhen using 'Per Tab' zoom, there is an option to reset to the default zoom level when loading a page (this is the default in Chrome, but not in Firefox).\n\nThere is an option to use a CSS Zoom engine instead of the browser's built-in zoom engine, which is particularly useful when using Chrome, since it avoids frequent zoom popups in the address bar.\n\nThere is an option to apply AutoFit zoom when a page is loaded or when the browser is resized. AutoFit is only applied if there is no site-specific zoom level already applied.\n\nThere is an option to show/hide the zoom mode and privacy warnings (only in Firefox).\n\nZOOM TYPE\n\nThere is an option to set the 'Zoom Type' as either 'Full' or 'Text'.\n\nWhen using the 'Full' zoom type, the currently selected zoom level will be applied to all elements (text, graphics and containers) in the page.\n\nWhen using the 'Text' zoom type, the currently selected zoom level will be applied to text elements in the page, and the default full zoom level will be applied to the other elements (graphics and containers) in the page.\n\nIMAGE SCALING\n\nZoom Page WE extends Firefox's 'View Image' functionality so that small images can be scaled to fit the browser window.\n\nThere are options to enable scaling of small images (so that images scale when clicked) and to apply scaling to images when they are loaded.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nPlease e-mail: dw-dev@gmx.com\n\nLICENSE\n\nDistributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.\nSee LICENCE.txt file and http://www.gnu.org/licenses/","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180729.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180729.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Zoom Page WE - toolbar button popup"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180730.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180730.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Zoom Page WE - popup zoom menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180731.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180731.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Zoom Page WE - toolbar button menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180732.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180732.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Zoom Page WE - context menu sub-menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180733.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","width":"269","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180733.png?src=api&modified=1506865779","thumbnailWidth":"77","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Zoom Page WE - options page"}],"homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/zoom-page-we/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zoom-page-we/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":4,"reviewCount":108,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zoom-page-we/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":145171,"weeklyDownloads":3790,"dailyUsers":42383,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/787814/zoom_page_we-7.2-an+fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":44234,"updateDate":1511524216000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"jid0-RwTySlpoKU14fw7yw2AflOAihhA@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/411/411216-32.png?modified=1501143621","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/411/411216-64.png?modified=1501143621"},"type":"extension","name":"QR Code Image Generator","version":"3.0.0","creator":{"name":"webdev7","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/webdev7/?src=api"},"description":"Create a QR code of the selected text, current url or hyperlink.

Therefore it is vital to learn new things every day and follow relevant and valuable sources of information effortlessly.\n\nWe believe privacy is important so that only you know what sources you follow.\n\nFeedbro feature highlights:\n- Full standalone feed reader (RSS, Atom, RDF) as a Firefox/Chrome/Vivaldi extension - no online services needed\n- Extremely fast!\n- Multiple viewing modes: full article view, headlines view, headlines + one article (Opera RSS reader style), newspaper view, magazine view\n- Can convert partial feeds to feeds with full articles with a built-in Readability style conversion engine!\n- Built-in Rule Engine lets you define rules for filtering, border highlighting, auto-bookmarking, tagging, hiding and regexp highlighting articles. Rules also support Chrome popup notifications and sound effects.\n- Article tagging and searching by a tag\n- IFTTT support!\n- Favicon support\n- Finds feeds from web pages and makes it very easy to subscribe to new feeds\n- Organizes feeds into folders (+ read all items in folder at once)\n- Drag & drop support for organizing feeds and folders in the tree navigator\n- Flexible \"mark as read\" options (when article title is shown, when article bottom is shown, manually)\n- 'Show only unread items' option helps you to read only what is new\n- Read any feeds that your computer can access (also in your company intranet, not only public Internet)\n- User interface themes: Light, Dark, Aqua, Sepia\n- Article filtering based on article age\n- Custom feed specific scan interval\n- Custom feed specific number of items to store\n- Keyboard shortcuts (similar to Google Reader)\n- Works well with high frequency update feeds\n- Can import feed subscriptions from an OPML file\n- Can export feed subscriptions to an OPML file\n- Easy to drop inactive or broken feeds\n- Article headline view for quick skimming\n- Basic authentication support to read password protected feeds\n- Article sharing to various social media sites like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Reddit etc and via Gmail/Email client\n- Buffer and Hootsuite support for scheduled social media sharing\n- Supports offline reading\n- Great for managing Youtube subscriptions!\n- Supports Firefox bookmarks import (Live Bookmarks & normal feed bookmarks)\n\nNOTE!: Due to current limitations in Firefox WebExtension implementation, IndexedDB storage does not work in \"Private Browsing\" mode or if you have \"Never remember history\" setting on or if you don't allow any sites to set cookies (Accept cookies from websites disabled) - you need to add Feedbro extension URL as an exception if you want to use this setting.\n\nSince Feedbro uses IndexedDB to store feed articles, Feedbro doesn't work in these situations. There are pending bugs in Bugzilla about this and we are hopeful that Firefox engineers will fix these issues.\n\nNOTE 2!: If Feedbro doesn't load any feeds, the most likely reason is that your Firefox profile has been corrupted regarding IndexedDB (this has happened to some users as they have upgraded FF). This means that IndexedDB cannot be used by any add-on or website. To fix this, open about:support and click \"Refresh Firefox\". Warning! This will remove all add-ons and their settings (backup Feedbro feeds in Options page before doing this).\n\nBug reports to feedbro.reader@gmail.com please","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185749.png?src=api&modified=1498829737","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185749.png?src=api&modified=1498829737","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185750.png?src=api&modified=1498829739","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185750.png?src=api&modified=1498829739","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185751.png?src=api&modified=1498829739","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185751.png?src=api&modified=1498829739","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185752.png?src=api&modified=1498829738","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185752.png?src=api&modified=1498829738","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185753.png?src=api&modified=1498829738","width":"640","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185753.png?src=api&modified=1498829738","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"}],"homepageURL":"http://nodetics.com/feedbro","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/?src=api","supportURL":null,"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/nodetics/5","contributionAmount":null,"averageRating":4,"reviewCount":63,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":28668,"weeklyDownloads":1676,"dailyUsers":8638,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/806451/feedbro_rss_feed_reader-3.35.0-an+fx-linux.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":1117593,"updateDate":1512859216000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"expire-history-by-days@bonardo.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/331/331631-32.png?modified=1505230651","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/331/331631-64.png?modified=1505230651"},"type":"extension","name":"Expire history by days","version":"1.3.1","creator":{"name":"Mak","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mak77/?src=api"},"description":"Allows to expire history older than a fixed amount of days.","fullDescription":"Expiration happens on idle, but it's not instant.\nFirst expiration step may take some time and blocks UI during that time, next ones will be much smaller and should not create any issue.\n\nWarning: the Places expiration system works to provide you the best performances in an automatic way.
