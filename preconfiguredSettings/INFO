  - Other directories will be listed to chose from as desktop layout choices
    during the install.

  - This is a directory that contains systemd services to be automatically
    installed to the system. All ".service" files listed here will be installed
	automatically.
- ./launchers/
  - This directory contains two subdirectories that hold ".desktop" launcher files.
  - ./autostart/
    - All ".desktop" files placed in here will be installed to /etc/xdg/autostart/

	  the system. The launchers will run with the login users account privileges.
  - ./applications/
    - ".desktop" files in this directory will be placed in /usr/share/applications/
	  This will make the launchers visible in the start menu for all users on the
