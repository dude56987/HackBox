:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Vibrantly Simple Colors Icon Theme 1 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Vibrantly Simple Colors By RAVEfinity is a NEW icon theme that attempts to be a modern continuation of the humanity icon theme, While still keeping humanitys simplicty and good points. It's released in 14 Colors! Despite this, the team has done this very efficently and the extra colors don't take up much more space at all.

Think of it as humanity with new folders and some updates and icons from elementary.
