:::::::::::::::::::::::: The Official Manual And Release Notes :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Version 1.1 (March 2015+) :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



:::::::::::::::::::::About This Theme:::::::::::::::::::::

Vibrantly Simple Colors By RAVEfinity is a NEW icon theme that attempts to be a modern continuation of the humanity icon theme, While still keeping humanity's simplicity and good points. Featuring new folders based on kde breeze icons with some new design by RAVEfinity. It's released in 13 Colors! Despite this, the team has done this very efficiently and the extra colors don't take up much more space at all.

Features Beautiful new modern folders icons based on KDE Breeze with elementary symbols and color and redesign by RAVEfinity.

Think of it as humanity with new folders and some updates and icons from elementary.

14 Colors of Folders are Selectable: Stock Manila Folders ,Blue , Aqua , Graphite , Blue Vivid (Dark), Brown, Green , Green Viva (Dark) Purple, Red , Pink, Orange, Teal, Yellow. 


2 Versions are Selectable:

Vibrantly Simple-Dark- Gives You Light Monochrome panel icons for a Dark panel theme. but then provides traditional toolbar icons (Color based)
Vibrantly Simple-Light- Gives You Monochrome panel icons for a Light panel theme. but then provides traditional toolbar icons (Color based)

This Icon Theme is totally independent it does not require anything else installed besides the standard gnome/hicolor theme (You have it if you have a GTK desktop). It was built with many/most monochrome icons built in, but apps that install additional ones should work as the icon theme will use Ubuntu Mono if any apps install icons there.

New 1.1: Adds New "Green Viva" Folder color. a calm dark green shade. Adds full support for Folder Color (Nemo, Nautualis, Caja extension) that allows on the fly recoloring of any folder to 14 diffrent colors. Fixes Scaling issues in GTK 3.14 Mime Icons.

Vibrantly Simple should work on any GTK Desktop On Any distro. but it has not been tested on ones released before then 2014. We did some complex linking and inheriting to make the theme slim and as few files as possible, this may cause issues on some older desktops but most likely not.

:::::::::::::::::::::ABOUT THEMES :::::::::::::::::::::


Most GTK 2 & 3 themes  or Icon Themes for Linux (BSD etc) are distributed in a tar.gz or zip format. by default. (Or more specifically  Source)

Some themes are available in .deb packages or rpm etc.. See our website to download them! If you get one in those formats you can safely install it (By double clicking on it) avoiding the need for manual installation discussed here.

This guide covers manually installing themes from SOURCE or tar.gz files! despite the "Scary name" there is no compiling or difficult things needed to a install a theme this way. Believe it or not the only thing you have to do is copy the theme files into the proper folder and your desktop should automatically recognize them!

Heres how we do that...
Thats being said just install and activate it on your desktop as shown bellow...

(!) Always back up your data and use these instructions at own risk! its not ours nor our contributors fault if anything goes wrong.
We have taken great strides to provide clear concise and safe instructions! But as always Do This at your own risk ! No Warranty!


:::::::::::::::::::::How to Install:::::::::::::::::::::

(!) THIS IS FOR MANUALLY INSTALLING THE THEME IF YOU OBTAINED IT IN A TAR.GZ FILE.
